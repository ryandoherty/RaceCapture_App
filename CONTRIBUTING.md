How to Contribute
=================

We love contributions from outside our
organization.   If you would like to contribute, please do the
following:

1. Fork our repository on Github
2. If you're taking on one of the issues, look for ones labeled 'bite-sized' as a good starter issue.
2. Make a feature branch and commit your changes there. Note any milestone for the feature.
3. Issue a pull request against the master branch, or a milestone target (typically r/X.Y.Z where X.Y.Z matches the milestone in the issue, if applicable) 
4. Once you've issued a request, we'll review your changes, comment and merge them once we've had a chance to test.


Coding Standard
===============

# Standard

We use PEP8 for our coding standard. Note, much of our older code is non PEP8 compliant; the goal is to update to PEP8 as we touch those areas.

# Documentation 
For class and method documentation, use reStructuredText http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html

Example: 

"""Documentation for function

:param var_name: <parameter description>
:type var_name: <type of param>
"""

File Headers
============

Always ensure that the file header at the top of the file matches the
following block. If it doesn't, please fix it as part of your patch.
